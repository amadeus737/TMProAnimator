# TMProAnimator
Extends TextMeshPro by adding in text animations. This package works by accessing the character meshes that TextMeshPro is built on. These meshes are then animated in a number of different ways, and a simple typewriter effect is also included. Tagged commands entered into a TextMeshPro text component are automatically parsed and interpreted into text animations.
